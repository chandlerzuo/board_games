A property-and-siege board game with a board, rule book, poker cards, event cards and territory deeds, playable in several themes. The repository folder is `board_games`.

## Themes

Every theme uses the same rules, prices, tolls and card strengths. A theme only changes names and pictures: the board, the place names, the characters on the poker cards, the names of some special and strategy cards, and the page title.

| Theme | Key | Setting | Commanders (the four aces) | Event decks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 三國風雲 | `sanguo` | Three Kingdoms (*三國演義*) | 曹操、劉備、孫權、董卓 | 緊急軍情 / 錦囊妙計 |
| 水滸群豪 | `shuihu` | Water Margin (*水滸傳*) | 宋江、盧俊義、晁蓋、方臘 | 江湖告急 / 智取妙計 |
| 封神演義 | `fengshen` | Investiture of the Gods (*封神演義*) | 姜子牙、姬發、黃飛虎、紂王 | 天機示警 / 仙家妙計 |
| 西遊歷險 | `xiyou` | Journey to the West (*西遊記*) | 唐三藏、孫悟空、豬八戒、牛魔王 | 妖魔作亂 / 菩薩錦囊 |
| 楚漢爭霸 | `chuhan` | Chu–Han Contention (*楚漢傳奇*) | 劉邦、項羽、韓信、秦二世 | 烽火急報 / 帷幄妙計 |

Pick the theme on the offline setup screen, or as host in the online lobby. In every theme the four 2-cards are figures known for supernatural powers (in Sanguo: 黃承彥、木鹿大王、于吉、張角), the 7s are mostly strategists, and the Jacks are the strongest fighters. The two rest squares, the treasure square and the recruiting square each use a place from that story (for example 鴻門, 阿房宮, 驪山陵 and 築壇拜將 in Chu–Han), and the event cards that mention people or places are reworded for each theme.

### Adding a theme

1. **`themes.js`**: add a `<KEY>_TILES` list (all 55 square names, in the same order as `TILES` in `engine.js`), a cards map, an entry in `THEMES` and the key in `order`. The entry has a `label`, `sub` (subtitle), `board` file name, `tiles`, `cards` (card code → name), `strategy` (strategy-card key → name), `kinds` (e.g. `overlord` → joker-card name) and `emergency` (event-card key → replacement text, title or agent). Anything not listed keeps the Sanguo version.
2. **Board**: run `python3 tools/make_board_svg.py`. It reads every theme in `order` and writes `board-<key>.svg`.
3. **Card art**: write a `theme-<key>-art.js` that calls `registerCardTheme('<key>', { fig, text, art, alias })`, like `theme-fengshen-art.js`, and load it in `index.html` after `theme-shuihu-art.js`. `alias` reuses another theme's special-card picture (for example `{ SK: 'shuihu:SK' }`), and `window.cardBanner([...])` draws a joker banner with your own text. Cards it doesn't cover use the Sanguo art.
4. **Online play and WeChat**: nothing to add. The server and `tools/build_wechat.js` pick up every theme from `themes.js`.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Page markup and styles |
| `engine.js` | Rules engine (no UI). Runs in the browser for offline play and in Node for online play |
| `client.js` | Board, side panel, dialogs and hover tips; the offline and online adapters |
| `texts.js` | Rules book and square descriptions, shared by the web version and the WeChat mini game |
| `cards.js` | SVG artwork for the 54 poker cards |
| `themes.js` | Theme data: square names, character names and card names for each theme |
| `theme-<key>-art.js` | Card portraits, descriptions and special-card art for each theme other than Sanguo (Sanguo's are in `cards.js`) |
| `board-<key>.svg` | One board per theme |
| `tools/make_board_svg.py` | Generates the board files from the names in `themes.js` (`--mobile` writes the portrait phone boards) |
| `wechat/` | WeChat mini game version (see [`wechat/README.md`](wechat/README.md)) |
| `tools/build_wechat.js`, `tools/wechat-preview/` | Builds the mini game's images and shared files; previews it in a browser |
| `server/server.js` | Online game server (Node.js, no dependencies) |
| `server/form.js` | Lets the server read answers to dialogs that contain form fields |

## Play offline (one computer)

Open `index.html` directly in a browser. Each seat can be a human or the computer; several humans can share one screen (the game asks you to pass the device before showing private cards). Pick the theme on the setup screen, or open `index.html?theme=shuihu` to start with Water Margin selected. `index.html?demo` runs a computer-only game; add `&theme=shuihu` for Water Margin.

## Play on WeChat (mini game)

`wechat/` is a WeChat mini game version with a portrait, phone-sized layout. Build it with `node tools/build_wechat.js`, then open the `wechat/` folder in WeChat DevTools. [`wechat/README.md`](wechat/README.md) covers the layout, how to let up to 15 friends test it as a 體驗版 (trial version), and what to fix before formal release.

## Play online (local test)

```sh
node server/server.js          # or SANGUO_PORT=9000 node server/server.js
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8765/> in several browser tabs or windows. Each tab is a separate player (the seat is remembered per tab, so reloading keeps your seat). The first player to join is the host, who can turn empty seats into computer players, choose the theme and start the game.

The game engine runs on the server, and each browser receives only that player's own view: your own hand, the public parts of the board, and cards you remember from public captures. Opponents' hands never reach your browser.

### Why it only runs on 127.0.0.1

This version has no login. The per-tab seat code only links a browser tab to a seat; it does not prove who someone is. The server therefore refuses to listen on anything other than `127.0.0.1` / `::1` / `localhost` (setting `SANGUO_HOST=0.0.0.0` makes it exit with an error).

### Before friends on other computers can join

1. **Host it on a personal account, not a corporate machine.** For example a personal cloud account or a hosting service that runs Node.js. Do not expose it from a work laptop or Cloud Desktop.
2. **Add a real sign-in** from the hosting platform or an identity provider (for example "Sign in with Google"), so each seat is tied to a verified account. Do not use home-made passwords or shared room codes.
3. **Serve it over HTTPS only.**
4. **Map signed-in accounts to seats** in `server/server.js` (`/api/join` and `seatByToken`) instead of the per-tab code, and only then allow a non-loopback listen address.
